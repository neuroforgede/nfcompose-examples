Examples for NF Compose.

# Baseline Setup

To start off, clone the original repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuroforgede/nfcompose
```

Switch to the `deploy` folder and setup the playground:

```bash
cd deploy
bash setup_playground.sh
```

You can now access the playground in your browser using the credentials `admin`/`admin`:

You can now continue to try out the examples. Every example will be set up in a separate tenant so there is no
need to setup a completely new NF Compose instance for every example.
